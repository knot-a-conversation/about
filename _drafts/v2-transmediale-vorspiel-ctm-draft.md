# transmediale / Vorspiel & CTM
Real conversations and a physical prototype.

## About
For [transmediale / Vorspiel & CTM](https://vorspiel.berlin/) the artists present the second version of the project. It completes the original concept developed during the CoLab Fellowship by introducing an enhanced digital version and by showcasing a first physical sculpture prototype. 

The event is part of Lacuna Lab's event series [Scattered Partners](https://lacunalab.org/events/transmediale-vorspiel-2021-or-scattered-partners).

Special thanks to [Hasan S.](https://curiouswala.com/) and [Anushka Trivedi](https://instagram.com/ophelia.game) for additional help with the GPT-3 implementation, and to [Nuño de la Serna](https://action-io.com/) for editing the video.*

## Process Notes
**Entanglements between datasets of today and datasets of the past**

Starting with the simpler machine learning models of classifying images, the smartphone app recognizes the knots in the sculpture. Each knot reveals a question the artists have embedded. These questions are provocations for the viewer about the relationship between creativity and Artificial Intelligence systems. The questions prompt a text-based machine learning model called GPT3. GPT3 is a widely recognised Machine Learning model, that uses human text prompts to generatively produce text. While the responses aren’t always coherent, they are able to maintain some relatability to the artists’ text prompts and are grammatically correct. These responses are reproduced on the smartphone app along with a computer-generated voice. The project’s second iteration adds a layer of human-like embodiment to the conversations with AI. 
At the heart of every AI and Machine Learning system are datasets. A mild mirroring of the quipu knots that were also datasets with dedicated “khipu kamayuq” the oral record keepers of the knots. 

Additionally, the project will maintain a repository of all the machine-generated responses. The repository will give an insight into the patterns and “thoughts” of the machine. 

For K(not) a Conversation a physical prototype was constructed that resembles a neural structure crossed by closed knots which can be identified by the number of crossings (above and below). To materialize the neural shape and knots with the quality we were looking for, we used a 3D printer machine that would allow us to scale the digital file. In that way not only the optics but also the haptics of the sculpture represent a symbolic element next to visual elements such as color or size.
Open source software such as Blender, was used for the digital manipulation and modification of the pieces along with manual labor for the final assembly.
